# replyBot-YT
This is a script made in nodejs that automatically replies to top comments as soon as a youtube channel uploads a video. I have already set some big youtube channels in the playlists, you just need to get the channel URL and replace the first 2 letter (UC) with UU. priority will do it faster for channels that are filled with these bots. I got 100k subscribers from doing this.
the bot does this reply:
Don't translate
[another language saying if the reader doesnt subscribe to your channel they will have a heart attack.]

how you import cookies is simple:
download firefox, log into youtube.
go to youtube
do F12 on browser
go to network.
go to a youtube video.
go to XHR section on network tab
clear the results.
